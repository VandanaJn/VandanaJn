### 📝 Professional Summary
Technical Lead and Senior AI Engineer with **20+ years of experience** in large-scale enterprise systems. I specialize in Agentic AI, LLM platforms, and RAG, moving systems from **fragile prototypes to secure, observable, and resilient production deployments.** As an instructor, I bridge the gap between "code that works" and "architectural excellence"—empowering engineering teams to master reliable agent orchestration through evaluation-driven design and structural code boundaries.

### 🚀 Featured AI Portfolio

#### [Repo Navigator AI](https://github.com/VandanaJn/Repo-Navigator-AI) | [Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54rGWONRcgc)
*Autonomous multi-agent system built using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) to replace manual repository exploration with instant architectural insights.*
* **The Architecture:** Designed a "Root Agent" that intelligently delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents.
* **Production Focus:** Implemented context window management (memory compaction) and integration testing with deterministic tool responses to prevent agent drift.

#### [Sage AI](https://github.com/VandanaJn/Sage-AI) | [Sage AI Sample](https://github.com/VandanaJn/VandanaJn/tree/main/sageai-sample)
*A production-grade RAG pipeline providing source-grounded reflections on meditation and inner growth.*
* **The Stack:** React, FastAPI, LlamaIndex, Pinecone, OpenAI GPT-4o-mini.
* **Innovation:** Utilizes **Sentence Window Parsing** to optimize vector database ingestion, prioritizing architectural boundaries and factual accuracy over unpredictable generation.

### 📺 Instructional Leadership
I teach through the lens of software architecture rather than just syntax. 

* **[Python Decorators Finally Make Sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhY3FDiwh-k):** Beyond basic syntax—how to use decorators as structural boundaries for resilient software. Features a self-healing `@retry` decorator designed to handle AI and network API instability.

### 🛠️ Core Technical Expertise
* **AI Orchestration:** Google ADK, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Vertex AI, Multi-agent architectures.
* **Production RAG:** Advanced grounding, citations, and hallucination reduction.
* **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS (Bedrock, Lambda, CDK, DynamoDB) & GCP (Vertex AI, Cloud Run).
* **Leadership:** IC+ style, owning end-to-end architecture while mentoring teams to deliver measurable value.
