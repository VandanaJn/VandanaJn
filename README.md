## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a Technical Lead and Senior AI Engineer with **20+ years of experience** designing, building, and operating **large-scale enterprise systems**, now focused on **agentic AI, LLM platforms, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

My work lives at the intersection of **AI innovation and engineering rigor**—moving systems from prototypes to **secure, observable, and reliable production deployments**. I enjoy solving complex, high-stakes problems where AI must integrate cleanly with existing platforms, APIs, and operational constraints.

I’m known for **IC+ leadership**: owning architecture end-to-end, mentoring engineers, and delivering systems that create measurable business value.

## 🔍 Current Focus Areas

- Agentic and tool-using AI systems  
- LLM orchestration, evaluation, and guardrails  
- Enterprise RAG with strong grounding and trust guarantees  
- Cloud-native, event-driven AI platforms  
- Production reliability, observability, and security

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Repo Navigator AI
**Agentic GitHub repository exploration and analysis**

Repo Navigator AI is a **tool-driven, multi-agent system** that helps engineers explore and understand GitHub repositories by **interacting directly with the GitHub API**, rather than pre-ingesting or indexing code.

**What it does**
- Uses specialized agents to navigate repositories, files, commits, and pull requests
- Dynamically retrieves code and metadata via GitHub API tools
- Provides source-aware, explainable responses grounded in live repository state
- Designed for architectural reasoning, onboarding, and codebase comprehension

**Why it matters**
- Avoids stale indexes and heavy ingestion pipelines  
- Mirrors how engineers actually explore real repositories  
- Emphasizes correctness, traceability, and tool-based reasoning

### 🔹 Sage AI
**Source-grounded RAG assistant with enterprise guardrails**

Sage AI is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed to deliver **trustworthy, source-backed answers** over curated knowledge bases.

**Highlights**
- Emphasis on grounding, citation, and hallucination reduction
- Designed with enterprise-grade guardrails and secure data handling
- Focus on observability, prompt discipline, and predictable behavior
- Built to be extended into production workflows rather than demos

Sage AI reflects my approach to RAG: **accuracy over cleverness**, and systems that can be safely deployed in real organizations.

## 🧠 Engineering Principles

- **Production-first AI**: reliability, security, and observability are mandatory  
- **Tooling over guessing**: agents should act, not hallucinate  
- **Systems thinking**: AI is part of a platform, not a feature  
- **Ownership mindset**: design it, ship it, support it
